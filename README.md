The aim of this thesis is to reconstruct and analyse snow cover in the Italian Alps using high-resolution daily grids of thermometric and pluviometric data. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop a model that allows both the accumulation processes and the subsequent evolution of the snowpack to be estimated. In this context, rainfall and temperature data are essential for determining whether precipitation occurs in the form of snow and for quantifying the melting of the snowpack itself. The result of the work will be the production of daily maps of snow cover and snow water equivalent (SWE) on a secular scale (approximately 1950-2020) in order to identify trends and interannual variations in snow resources, as well as to assess the dependence of snow distribution on factors such as altitude, exposure and climate. To verify the reliability of the model developed, the estimates will be compared with ground observations and satellite products when available.
