# We already localized faulty pixels in Comacchio valleys. We should now focus on
# 2011 and 2013 years, which look suspicious. I would like to make a plot containing
# four subplots. The first row would be concerning 2011, whilst the second one 2013.
# The left panel should contain SCD values for the whole region and the other one 
# should show only pixels identified as faulty.
